        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>This is Haojie Hu from Planet Earth. "Haojie" is my first name, it is written as "豪杰" in Chinese character, which means "a hero, a brave man". The pronunciation is like "How Jet" (with "t" silent). My family name is "Hu", with pronunciation like "who". In China, we have family name comes first, so it is written as "胡豪杰". You can just call me "Haojie [How Jet (with "t" silent)]" or just "Jie [Jet (with "t" silent)]".</p>
        <p>Now I am a JSPS fellow, working with Prof. Ken Ohsuga at University of Tsukuba. My research interests focus on SuperMassive Black Holes (SMBHs). I am interested in the formation and evolution of SMBHs at high redshifts (z>6), and their co-evolution with host galaxies (the co-evolution scenario). The interplay between central SMBHs and their host galaxies especially in Active Galactic Nuclei (aka, AGN feeding and feedback), always fascinates me. I try to understand the growth pathway of seed BH to SMBHs at high redshifts via numerical simulations.</p>

        <h3>Research Highlights</h3>
        <h4>High-z Quasars and the Formation of SMBHs</h4>
        <p>Observations on high-z Quasars indicate the existence of 10^9~10^10 Solar Mass SMBHs at z ~ 6-7. It is challenging to grow such SMBHs by the limited 'Eddington accretion rate', even at 100% duty cycle. Two alternatives are proposed to explain the formation and evolution of these SMBHs: "Heavy Seed BHs" and "Rapid growth". I investigate the rapid growth of seed BHs via simulations.</p>
        
        <h4>Evolutionary Tracks of Heavy Seed BHs</h4>
        <p>Heavy seed BHs (10^5 solar mass, seed at z=15), can always grow faster than host galaxies, reaching the overmassive region in the mass-mass diagram compared to local relations. We propose a subgrid feeding (and feedback) model for seed BHs at galactic centers. Such a subgrid model can facilitate the rapid growth of seed BHs at high-z universe, when the outflow strength is moderate (p ~ 0.5-0.7). For strong outflows (p>0.7), the rapid growth of light seed BHs are significantly suppressed.</p>
       
        <h4>AGN Feedback in Perseus Cluster</h4>
        <p>The 1/2 slope of VSF for Halpha-traced cold gas filaments in Perseus can be well explained by the cold components of a supersonic hot outflow driven by AGN activities when it cools down radiatively after about 10-20 Myr. We reproduced varied morphologies of cold gas similar to the observed ones in Perseus (i.e., radial filaments, horseshoe filament, blueloop like structures) in simulations. The origin of these cold filaments also indicates the energetics of the AGN activities. The subsequent evolution of cold gas may also indicate the positive AGN feedback in a 10-20 Myr time delay.</p>
