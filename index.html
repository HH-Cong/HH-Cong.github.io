        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>This is Haojie Hu from Planet Earth. "Haojie" is my first name, it is written as "豪杰" in Chinese character, which means "a hero, a brave man". The pronunciation is like "How Jet" (with "t" silent). My family name is "Hu", with pronunciation like "who". In China, we have family name comes first, so it is written as "胡豪杰". You can just call me "Haojie [How Jet (with "t" silent)]" or just "Jie [Jet (with "t" silent)]".</p>
        <p>Now I am a JSPS fellow, working with Prof. Ken Ohsuga at University of Tsukuba. My research interests focus on SuperMassive Black Holes (SMBHs). I am interested in the formation and evolution of SMBHs at high redshifts (z>6), and their co-evolution with host galaxies (the co-evolution scenario). The interplay between central SMBHs and their host galaxies especially in Active Galactic Nuclei (aka, AGN feeding and feedback), always fascinates me. I try to understand the growth pathway of seed BH to SMBHs at high redshifts via numerical simulations.</p>

            <h4>High-z Quasars and the Formation of SMBHs</h4>
            <img src="./img/high-z_SMBH_M-Z_with_legend.png" alt="High-z SMBHs" height="400">
            <p> 
                Observations on high-z Quasars indicate the existence of 10<sup>9</sup>-10<sup>10</sup> Solar Mass SMBHs at z &#8776; 6-7. 
                It is challenging to grow such SMBHs by the 'Eddington accretion rate' due to balance between radiation and gravity, even at 100% duty cycle. 
                Two alternatives are proposed to explain the formation and evolution of these SMBHs: "Heavy Seed BHs" 
                and "Rapid growth (super-Eddington growth) of seed BHs" . I am applying simulations and analytical models to explain their existences.

        <h4>Co-evolution between seed BHs and host galaxies in MM diagram</h4>
        <img src="./img/MM_diagram_for_seeds.png" alt="1evolution tracks to high-z SMBHs" height="400">
        <p>Based on simulation results regarding super-Eddington accretion onto seed BHs, we propose a subgrid feeding 
            (and feedback) model for seed BHs at galactic centers. Such a subgrid model can facilitate the rapid 
            growth of seed BHs at high-z universe, when the outflow strength is moderate (p ~ 0.5-0.7). We apply the feeding
            model to heavy seeds and light seeds at z=20. We find that despite their vast difference upon their seeding, 
            seed BHs go through super-Eddington accretion when gas supply is sufficient. The rapid growth results in a high
            BH-mass-to-galaxy-mass ratio, consistent with recent JWST SMBHs at high redshift.

        <h4>Redshift evolution of MM ratio for two seeding scenarios</h4>
        <img src="./img/data+model.png" alt="converged tracks to high-z SMBHs" height="400">
        <p>However, the rapid growth of seed BHs also erase their seeding information, making it hard to distinguish 
            the formation channels for different seeds. This figure showcase the convergent evolution of BH-mass-to-galaxy-mass 
            ratios for heavy and light seed BHs. Even so, it is still possible to disentangle the degeneracy before they converge. 
            It indicates that high ratio SMBHs found at z~10 are probably originated from heavy seeds (DCBHs), as the 
            convergence occurs after z~9-8.

        <h4>AGN Feedback in galaxy Cluster (Perseus Cluster)</h4>
        <img src="./img/fig3.png" alt="VSF of cold gas filaments" height="400">
        <p>
            AGN feedback is thought to be responsible for the co-evolution between SMBHs and host galaxies. Yet, it is 
            difficult to diagnostic energetics of AGN feedback. The outflow, originating from SMBH accretion, carries
            the energetic information of AGN activities. To this concern, we build an analytical model to investigate the 
            formation and evolution of AGN-driven outflows. We apply this model to account for the formation and evolution 
            of cold gas filaments in Perseus cluster, deciphering the AGN energetics.
            We find that the 1/2 slope of velocity structure function (VSF) for Halpha-traced cold gas filaments in Perseus 
            can be well explained by the cold components of a supersonic hot outflow driven by AGN activities when it cools 
            down radiatively after about 10-20 Myr. We reproduced varied morphologies of cold gas similar to the observed 
            ones in Perseus (i.e., radial filaments, horseshoe filament, blueloop like structures) in simulations. The origin 
            of these cold filaments also indicates the energetics of the AGN activities. The subsequent evolution of cold gas may also 
            indicate the positive AGN feedback in a 10-20 Myr time delay.

        <h4>Super-Eddington accretion onto BHs</h4>
        <img src="./img/Paper3fig3.png" alt="Super-Eddington accretion" height="400">
        <p>
            Super-Eddington accretion onto BHs is believed to be responsible for the rapid growth of seed BHs at high redshfit 
            and for some ultra-luminous X-ray binaries. It is believed that when sufficient dense gas is fed to the BH, 
            the radiation will be trapped within the dense disks, resulting in negligible feedback effects to large scale gas supply.
            The minimum negative feedback effects enable super-Eddington accretion. To this end, we apply 2D RHD simulations to 
            study the long-term evolution of super-Eddington accretion onto BHs considering effective photon-trapping. We realize a 
            quasi-steady super-Eddington accretion. This figure shows the 2D distribution of the sound speed and gas density at two 
            different scales for the fiducial case when the simulation terminates. On the larger scale (left panel), the overall flow 
            pattern is governed by convective motion and shows that the gas is inflowing through the equatorial region and a similar 
            amount of gas is outflowing to the polar regions. On the smaller scale (right panel), the inflows dominate over the outflows 
            owing to strong gravity. The strong outflow results in a decrease of inflow rate towards BH. This behavior is consistent with
            other radiation inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) simulations.
